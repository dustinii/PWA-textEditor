## (PWA) Text Editor

This project is a text editor that runs in the browser, designed to meet the Progressive Web Applications (PWA) criteria. It serves as a single-page application showcasing various data persistence techniques ensuring data redundancy across various browser compatibilities. It also works offline, utilizing the `idb` package, a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API used by companies like Google and Mozilla.
